# Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program
This repository holds my solutions to my attempt at Quantium's Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program, which could be found here: https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/NkaC7knWtjSbi6aYv/Data-Analytics

## Introduction
Quantium is a global leader in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) that was founded back in 2002. As of moment of writing, they have 11 offices worldwide, employing over 800 people. They partner with clients across different sectors, helping them maximize their potential, while addressing some of their most pressing challenges that they may face. Through this program, I had the opportunity to act as a data analyst at Quantium, performing tasks such as data validation, visualisation, statistical testing and more.

## Task 1.
Conduct analysis on your client's transaction dataset and identify customer purchasing behaviours to generate insights and provide commercial recommendations.

* Transaction data - Look for inconsistencies, missing data, outliers and category items. 
* Customer data - Do the same for the customer data.
* Data Merge - Merge the two data sets once they have been cleaned.
* Exploratory Data Analysis - Explore the data, such as which stores had the total sales, which products were the most popular according to demographics, and for those products, their size/weight. Create visualisations to emphasise your points.
* Recommendations – From the exploration done above, provide a list of recommendations to the stores.


## Task 2: Experimentation and Uplift Testing
Extend your analysis from Task 1 to help you identify benchmark stores that allow you to test the impact of the trial store layouts on customer sales.
* Control stores – Define metrics to use to decide if a store should be a control store. This could be their monthly overall sales, monthly customer count, monthly transactions per customer or a mix of any of these.
* Trial Assessment – Compare those same metrics for all trial stores, against the control store of your choice to assess their performance. This could also include the correlation between the performance of the trial stores and the control stores.
* Findings – Summarise your findings for each store and provide an recommendation outlining the impact on sales during the trial period. Visualisations are recommended, as it would be a great addition to the presentation in Task 3.


## Task 3.
Use the insights and visualisations that you developed from Task 1 and 2 to create a PowerPoint presentation for your client in a clear and concise manner.
